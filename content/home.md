André Johansson
============================

My name is André Johansson, also known as Andy to my friends. Originally I come from a little town in Skåne that I love. But to study web programming in Karlskrona, I have moved to Karlshamn. It’s not optimal - takes me about 40 minutes to get to school by car. But hoping to get an apartment closer to school soon.

I have previously worked quite a bit with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And also played around a little with PHP and design of web pages. Besides the coding, I do enjoy creating and editing images in Photoshop for websites. It’s something I have been doing in my free time since I was maybe 12 years old, just for fun. Coding is something I started with in last year of secondary school. It was something I had been wanting to try out, and finally got the opportunity to select it as a course in third year. Since then I’ve been hooked. ;)

When I don’t study I often play around with web stuff anyway. But it’s often Wordpress that I do then, because it’s quicker. Otherwise, well, I’m a pretty big gamer and been playing video games since before I was ten. TV series usually takes up a lot of time as well. But, I’m also really into airplanes and astronomy. Astronomy is something I’ve found in later years, but I’ve always loved airplanes and flying since I was very small. Hoping to one day be able to get a private pilot’s license in my hometown.
